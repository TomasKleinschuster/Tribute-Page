            <h3>Here are some of his best quotes:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    “You have power over your mind - not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength.”
                </li>
                <li>
                    “Dwell on the beauty of life. Watch the stars, and see yourself running with them.”</li>
                <li>
                    “The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts.”
                </li>
                <li>
                    “Everything we hear is an opinion, not a fact. Everything we see is a perspective, not the truth.” 
                </li>
                <li>
                    “Waste no more time arguing about what a good man should be. Be one.” 
                </li>
                <li>
                    “The best revenge is to be unlike him who performed the injury.”
                </li>
                <li>
                    “If it is not right do not do it; if it is not true do not say it.”
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>His last words:</h3>
