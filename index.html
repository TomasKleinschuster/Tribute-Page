                <h3>Here are some of his best quotes:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        “You have power over your mind - not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength.”
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        “Dwell on the beauty of life. Watch the stars, and see yourself running with them.”
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        “The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts.”
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        “Everything we hear is an opinion, not a fact. Everything we see is a perspective, not the truth.” 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        “Waste no more time arguing about what a good man should be. Be one.” 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        “The best revenge is to be unlike him who performed the injury.”
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        “If it is not right do not do it; if it is not true do not say it.”
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        “Reject your sense of injury and the injury itself disappears.”
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    <p>
                        “Go to the rising sun, for I am setting.”
                    </p>
